This tutorial lists important definitions used throughout the Mezuro website. Knowing them is vital for complete understanding of the platform.

## Keywords

### Granularity
Represents the granularity level of the code fragment being measured. Mezuro uses five levels of granularity:

  - Method
  - Function
  - Class
  - Package
  - Software

### Module
Represents a fragment of the software. Every node in the processing tree generated by the Kalibro processor is a module and each module has a _granularity_.

### Range
Represents numerical intervals that may contain the value calculated for a given _metric_. Ranges combined with readings provide interpretations for _metric results_.

### Reading
The interpretation given to a _metric result_ (e.g., "Good", "Complex", "A"). Readings combined with ranges provide interpretations for _metric results_.

### Reading Group
A set of _readings_ that make sense when grouped together (e.g., "Good" and "Bad", "Simple" and "Complex").

### Configuration
A set of _metrics_.

### Metric Result
It is a numerical result associated to a metric by the Collector or by aggregation in the case of a Compound Metric.

### Metric
A software metric is a quantitative measure of some property of a module. For more details see the [publications](/publications/) page.
