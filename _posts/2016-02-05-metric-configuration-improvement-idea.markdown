Metric Configurations are the structure that give a meaning to the data obtained by the Metric Collectors.
They can be used, in conjunction with Kalibro Ranges, to create standards for code quality between projects.

Therefore, statistics about their metrics' use would greatly help the creation of new Kalibro Configurations
and set standards for project analysis. Also, the presentation of these results could be better, with more
charts and comparisons to previous analyses.
