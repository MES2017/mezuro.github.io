Mezuro has been subject to academic studies:

* Carlos Morais MSc dissertation (in Portuguese): [Kalibro: interpretação de métricas de código-fonte](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-25092013-142158/en.php)
* Paulo Meirelles PhD thesis (in Portuguese): [Monitoramento de métricas de código-fonte em projetos de software livre](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-27082013-090242/en.php)
* Conference article: [Semi-Automatic Evaluation of Free Software Projects: A Source Code Perspective](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Knutson2/publication/236576904_Open_Source_From_Mythos_to_Meaning/links/53f239470cf272810e4cb2dc.pdf#page=50)

In addition we have a [repository](https://github.com/mezuro/mezuro-presentations) with plentiful of presentations (mostly in Portuguese) and article drafts. We are currently working on studying how the refactor of Kalibro Legacy (Java + SOAP monolith) into both KalibroProcessor and KalibroConfigurations services (Rails + REST) has affected [scalability](https://github.com/mezuro/scalability_tests).
