Currently, the [website](http://mezuro.org/) has a lot of issues related to the UI that can be improved.

* Layouts: Focusing on the forms for the creation of accounts, Reading Groups, Projects, Repositories, Configurations, etc.
* Charts: For displaying the Metric Results.
* Organization of Grades: Specifically targeting the module results, which need to be manually clicked through to show their submodules' grades (in the case of Tree Metric Configurations).
