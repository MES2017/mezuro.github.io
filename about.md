The Mezuro project attempts to provide a platform to compare projects and metric techniques, teaching how to use metrics through configurations and code analysis, avoid technical debts and disseminate code metrics usage and understanding.

The project is divided into it's front-end, called [prezento](https://github.com/mezuro/prezento), it's services
related to the configuration necessary for each analysis
([Kalibro Configurations](https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro_configurations)) and to their actual execution
([Kalibro Processor](https://github.com/mezuro/kalibro_processor)), which uses metric collectors such as
[Analizo](http://www.analizo.org/), [Radon](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/radon) and
[MetricFu](https://github.com/metricfu/metric_fu) to obtain the relevant measurements associated with a
given code base.

Check it under production at [mezuro.org](mezuro.org).
