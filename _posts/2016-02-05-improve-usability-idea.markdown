Prezento has been created back in 2013 using Twitter Bootstrap. Since then, lots of features got in gradually degrading its usability. Currently, the [website](http://mezuro.org/) has a lot of issues related to the UI that can be improved.

* **Layouts**: Focusing on the forms for the creation of accounts, Reading Groups, Projects, Repositories, Configurations, etc
* **Charts**: For displaying the Metric Results
* **Organization of Grades**: Specifically targeting the module results, which need to be manually clicked through to show their submodules' grades (in the case of Tree Metric Configurations).
